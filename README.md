## Mastermind (I developed a application to play the game 'Mastermind')

I wanted to recreate a game I enjoy using Python and OOP. I built classes to represent players, and the rules for playing hands built as methods in those classes.

The application allows you to:
- Play mastermind vs the computer 
- Error handling to avoid crashing based on user input
- Class inheritance between code entries and full codes.
- High score file as a csv which is updated each game
- Algorithm logic to score each guess (complex if and for/while loops)
